Astro-Coord-ECI

This package implements the NORAD orbital propagation models described
in their "SPACETRACK REPORT NO. 3, Models for Propagation of NORAD
Element Sets," plus various support classes.  In other words, it turns
the two- or three-line element sets available from such places as
http://www.space-track.org/ or http://celestrak.com/ into predictions
of where the relevant orbiting bodies will be.

The package also includes a script, "satpass", which uses the classes
to implement a satellite visibility prediction system.

This package is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Astro-Coord-ECI-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Astro-Coord-ECI-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the Astro/Coord/ECI directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
