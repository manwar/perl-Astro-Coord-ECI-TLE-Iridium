DESCRIPTION

This package contains classes needed to predict satellite visibility,
and a demonstration application (satpass) that makes use of these
classes. The classes themselves are:

Astro::Coord::ECI - superclass (coordinate transforms)
Astro::Coord::ECI::Moon - Predict location of the Moon.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Star - Predict location of a star.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun - Predict location of the Sun.
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE - Predict location of a satellite.
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Iridium - Subclass of TLE, with the ability
    to predict flares.
Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE::Set - Aggregation of TLEs, with ability
    to use the correct TLE depending on time.
Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils - Constants and utility subroutines.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by either of the two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf Astro-satpass-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf Astro-satpass-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the Astro/Coord/ECI directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
