Astro::NORAD::Orbit

This module implements the NORAD orbital propagation models described
in their "SPACETRACK REPORT NO. 3, Models for Propagation of NORAD
Element Sets." In other words, it turns the two- or three-line
element sets available from such places as http://www.space-track.org/
or http://celestrak.com/ into predictions of where the relevant
orbiting bodies will be. This module does NOT implement a complete
satellite prediction system, just the NORAD models - that is, you get
satellite positions in Cartesian coordinates, and it's up to you
to figure out what to do with them.

This module is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Astro-NORAD-Orbit-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Astro-SNORAD-Orbit-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
Orbit.pm into the Astro/NORAD directory (creating it if necessary) in
the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
