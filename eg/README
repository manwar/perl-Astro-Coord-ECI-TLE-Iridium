This directory contains examples of how to use Astro::Coord::ECI and
its subclasses. The following examples are provided:

almanac
    This Perl script produces an almanac of Sun and Moon positions for
    the current day, or optionally for the next day. By default the
    almanac is for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington DC, but this can
    be changed by setting environment variable ALMANAC_POSITION, or
    specifying latitude north (degrees), longitude east (degrees),
    and height (meters) on the command. The option -help gets you
    brief help.

iridium
    This Perl script uses Astro::SpaceTrack (not included) to download
    Iridium data from http://celestrak.com/ and predict flares for the
    next two days at the given location, which is hard-coded as Los
    Pinos, Ciudad Mexico, Mexico. It takes about 30 seconds on a
    lightly-loaded 800 MHz PowerPC G4.

iss
    This Perl script uses Astro::SpaceTrack (not included) to download
    orbital data from http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/ and
    predict visibility for the next week from the given location, which
    is hard-coded as 80 Wellington Street Ottawa Ontario Canada.

sh_script
    This shell script executes the satpass Perl script (which comes with
    this distribution) passing it commands from a 'here document.' These
    commands download International Space Station data from
    http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/ and predict
    visibility at the current time from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
    Washington DC, USA.
