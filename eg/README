This directory contains examples of how to use Astro::Coord::ECI and
its subclasses. The following examples are provided:

almanac
    This Perl script produces an almanac of Sun and Moon positions for
    the current day, or optionally for the next day. By default the
    almanac is for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington DC, but this can
    be changed by setting environment variable ALMANAC_POSITION, or
    specifying latitude north (degrees), longitude east (degrees),
    and height (meters) on the command. The option -help gets you
    brief help.

sh_script
    This shell script executes the satpass Perl script (which comes with
    this distribution) passing it the commands in sh_data, which is
    described below.

sh_data
    This file contains the commands fed to the satpass script by
    sh_script. It downloads International Space Station data from
    NASA's manned spaceflight center and predicts visibility
    of the ISS from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, USA.
