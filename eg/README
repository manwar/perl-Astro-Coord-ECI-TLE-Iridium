almanac
    This script produces an almanac of Sun and Moon positions for the
    current day, or optionally for the next day. By default the almanac
    is for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington DC, but this can be
    changed by setting environment variable ALMANAC_POSITION, or
    specifying latitude north (degrees), longitude east (degrees),
    and height (meters) on the command. The option -help gets you
    brief help.
